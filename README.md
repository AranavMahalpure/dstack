# dstack

#### dstack is a new open-core platform that automates data and training workflows. 

dstack allows you to define workflows and
their infrastructure requirements as code. The platform provisions infrastructure on demand, and versions data and
models. It allows you to use any frameworks, experiment trackers, cloud vendors, or hardware.
