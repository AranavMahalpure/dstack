dstack makes it easy to build AI apps and collaborate.

* You can define common tasks (such as preparing data, training models, running apps, etc.), as workflows 
  and run them in the cloud with one command. 
* The platform automatically saves output artifacts in the cloud, and allow you to version them via tags to reuse and share with others.
* You can configure your own cloud account (e.g. AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.)
* The platform is easily extensible through [providers](providers). Provider add support for
  various languages, training and application frameworks, dev environments, etc.

This repository contains the open source code of the built-in [providers](providers), the [CLI](cli), and [documentation](docs). 

## üìò Documentation

See full documentation at [docs.dstack.ai](https://docs.dstack.ai)

## üöÄ Getting started

To use dstack, you have to [create an account](https://dstack.ai/signup), and 
obtain your personal token.

### Install the CLI

Here's how to do it:

```bash
pip install dstack
dstack config --token <token> 
```

### Define workflows

Your common project tasks can be defined as workflows:

<details>
<summary>Click to see an example</summary>

```yaml
workflows:
  - name: prepare
    help: "Loads and prepares the training data" 
    provider: python
    file: "prepare.py"
    artifacts: ["data"]

  - name: train
    help: "Trains a model and saves the checkpoints"
    depends-on:
      - prepare:latest
    provider: python
    file: "train.py"
    artifacts: ["checkpoint"]
    resources:
      gpu: 1
      
  - name: app
    help: "Launches an app to play with the model"
    depends-on:
      - train:latest
    provider: streamlit
    target: "app.py"
```
</details>

Run any workflow in the cloud via a single command:

```bash
$ dstack run train
```

For more examples, check out the [examples](examples) folder.

### Run providers

Workflows are optional. You can run providers directly from the CLI:

```bash
dstack run python train.py \
  --dep prepare:latest --artifact checkpoint --gpu 1
```

### Run applications

Here's how to run a Streamlit application:

```bash
dstack run streamlit app.py --dep model:latest
```


### Launch dev environments

If you need an interactive dev environment, you can have it too through the corresponding provider:

```bash
dstack run code app.py --dep prepare:latest --gpu 1
```

This will run a VS Code with mounted artifacts and requested hardware resources.
