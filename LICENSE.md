The dstack monorepo relies upon multiple different licenses.

# License Guide

The license for a particular work is defined with following prioritized rules:
1. License information directly present in the file
1. `LICENSE`, `LICENSE.md` or `LICENSE.txt` file in the same directory as the work
1. First `LICENSE`, `LICENSE.md` or `LICENSE.txt` file found when exploring parent directories up to the project top level directory
1. Defaults to the Apache License 2.0
