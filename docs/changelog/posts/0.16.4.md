# dstack 0.16.4: CUDO Compute integration

On our journey to provide an open-source, cloud-agnostic platform for orchestrating GPU workloads, we are proud to
announce another step forward â€“ the integration with [CUDO Compute](https://www.cudocompute.com/solutions/gpu-cloud/).
<!-- more -->

CUDO Compute is a GPU marketplace that offers cloud resources at an
affordable cost in a number of locations. Currently, the available GPUs include A40, RTX A6000, 
RTX A4000, RTX A5000, and RTX 3080.

To use it with `dstack,` you only need to configure the `cudo` backend with your CUDO Compute
project ID and API key:

<div editor-title="~/.dstack/server/config.yml">

```yaml
projects:
- name: main
  backends:
  - type: cudo
    project_id: my-cudo-project
    creds:
      type: api_key
      api_key: 7487240a466624b48de22865589
```

</div>

Once it's done, you can restart the `dstack server` and use the `dstack` CLI or API to run 
workloads.

<div class="termy">

```shell
$ dstack run . -b cudo 
 #  BACKEND  REGION       RESOURCES              SPOT  PRICE

    ...

```

</div>

Just like with other backends, the `cudo` backend allows you to launch dev environments, run tasks, and deploy
services with `dstack run`, and manage your pool of instances via `dstack pool`.

??? info "Limitations"
    The `dstack gateway` feature is not yet compatible with `cudo`, but it is expected to be supported in version `0.17.0`,
    planned for release within a week.

    The `cudo` backend cannot yet be used with [dstack Sky](https://sky.dstack.ai), but it will also be enabled within a week.

Haven't tried `dstack` yet? You're very welcome to [do so](https://dstack.ai/#get-started) now. With `dstack`, 
orchestrating GPU workloads over any cloud is very easy!
