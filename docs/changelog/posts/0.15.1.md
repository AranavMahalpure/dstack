# dstack 0.15.1: Kubernetes integration preview

In addition to a few bug fixes, the latest update brings initial integration with Kubernetes (experimental) and adds the
possibility to configure a custom VPC for AWS. Read below for more details.

## Configuring a Kubernetes backend

With the latest update, it's now possible to configure a Kubernetes backend. In this case, if you run a
workload, `dstack`
will provision infrastructure within your Kubernetes cluster. This may work with both self-managed and managed clusters.

??? info "Prerequisite"
    To use GPUs with Kubernetes, the cluster must be installed with the
    [NVIDIA GPU Operator](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/index.html).

To configure a Kubernetes backend, you need to specify the path to the kubeconfig file,
and the port that `dstack` can use for proxying SSH traffic.
In case of a self-managed cluster, also specify the IP address of any node in the cluster.

=== "Self-managed"

    Here's how to configure the backend to use a self-managed cluster.

    <div editor-title="~/.dstack/server/config.yml">

    ```yaml
    projects:
    - name: main
      backends:
      - type: kubernetes
        kubeconfig:
          filename: ~/.kube/config
        networking:
          ssh_host: localhost # The external IP address of any node
          ssh_port: 32000 # Any port accessible outside of the cluster
    ```

    </div>

    The port specified to `ssh_port` must be accessible outside of the cluster.
    
    For example, if you are using Kind, make sure to add it via `extraPortMappings`:

    <div editor-title="installation/kind-config.yml"> 

    ```yaml
    kind: Cluster
    apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
    nodes:
    - role: control-plane
      extraPortMappings:
      - containerPort: 32000 # Must be same as `ssh_port`
        hostPort: 32000 # Must be same as `ssh_port`
    ```

    </div>

=== "Managed"
    Here's how to configure the backend to use a managed cluster (AWS, GCP, Azure).

    <div editor-title="~/.dstack/server/config.yml">

    ```yaml
    projects:
    - name: main
      backends:
      - type: kubernetes
        kubeconfig:
          filename: ~/.kube/config
        networking:
          ssh_port: 32000 # Any port accessible outside of the cluster
    ```

    </div>

    The port specified to `ssh_port` must be accessible outside of the cluster.
    
    For example, if you are using EKS, make sure to add it via an ingress rule
    of the corresponding security group:

    ```shell
    aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id <cluster-security-group-id> --protocol tcp --port 32000 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
    ```

!!! info "NOTE:"
    While `dstack` supports both self-managed and managed clusters, if you're using AWS, GCP, or Azure, it's generally
    recommended to corresponding backends directly for greater efficiency and ease of use.

## Specifying a custom VPC for AWS

If you're using `dstack` with AWS, it's now possible to configure a custom VPC via `~/.dstack/server/config.yml`:

<div editor-title="~/.dstack/server/config.yml">

```yaml
projects:
- name: main
  backends:
  - type: aws
    vpc_name: my-custom-vpc
    regions: [us-west-2, eu-west-1]
    creds:
      type: default
```

</div>

In this case, `dstack` will attempt to utilize the VPC with the configured name in each region. If any region lacks a VPC
with that name, it will be skipped.

!!! info "NOTE:"
    All subnets of the configured VPC should be public; otherwise, `dstack` won't be able to manage workloads.
