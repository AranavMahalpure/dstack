### üß¨ Workflow

Typical data and training pipelines consist of multiple steps. These steps may include loading data,
preparing data, training, validating, testing a model, etc. In dstack, each of these steps is called a `Workflow`.
Learn more on how to [define workflows](workflows.md).

### üß© Workflow provider

A workflow `Provider` is a program that defines how a `Workflow` materializes into actual `Jobs` that 
process and output data according to the workflow parameters.

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Run

Once you run a `Workflow`, the running instance of this workflow is called a `Run`. All jobs created by the workflow
provider are linked to this run.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Job

When you run a `Workflow`, the `Provider` creates the actual `Jobs` that run this workflow.

Every `Job` is associated with a repo with the sources, a Docker image, commands, exposed ports, an ID of the primary job (in
case there should be communication between `Jobs`), the input `Artifacts` (e.g. from other runs), 
the hardware requirements (e.g. the number or a name of GPU, memory, etc.), and finally the output `Artifacts`.

### üì¶ Artifact

Every `Job` may produce output `Artifacts`. When a `Job` is running, dstack stores the output `Artifacts` for 
every `Job` in real-time.

If a `Workflow` depends on another `Workflow`, all output `Artifacts` of every `Job` of that other `Workflow` will be
mounted as input `Artifacts` to every `Job` of your `Workflow` when it runs.

### üè∑ Tags

It's possible to assign a `Tag` to any successful `Run` to reuse its `Artifacts` in other `Workflows`. 
By using `Tags`, it's possible to version data and models, and reuse it within the team or across.

### ü§ñ Runner

A `Runner` is a machine that runs `Jobs`. `Runners` are provisioned by dstack on-demand from the configured
`Computing Vendors` (such as AWS, GCP, Azure, and others.) As an alternative to on-demand `Runners`, it's also possible 
to use your own hardware as `Runners` (this is called self-hosted `Runners`).
